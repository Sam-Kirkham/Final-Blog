#### Get to Know Me
I love anything and everything outdoors. One of my favorite hobbies is disc golf, I love that it gets me outdoors and into the mountains. I also love soccer, I have played soccer since I was a little kid. I've never played in high school or college, I've only ever played for fun in recreation leagues and competitive leagues. 
Just some small fun facts about me: I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Atlanta Georgia, I love Dr. Pepper and despite going to BYU my favorite college football team is the Georgia Football team.
