# Intro Data Wrangling and Visualization

### About Me
Hi! My name is Sam Kirkham, I am a statistics major at BYU! A few things about me: I am from Kaysville Ut, I love the outdoors, and I love anything and everything sports. I love watching basketball and football and love working on data for both of these sports as well.

Two things I have loved learning about are data cleaning and visualization. In this blog I want to share an example as I teach a little bit about this process using sports data. In this example I am looking at the Los Angeles Lakers and whether playing at home or on the road impacts the results of their games. I hope you enjoy!
