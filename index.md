# Intro Data Wrangling and Visualization

### About Me
Hi! My name is Sam Kirkham, I am a statistics major at BYU and I have loved learning about basic data cleaning and visualization steps. In this blog I want to share an example as I teach a little bit about this process using sports data. I hope you enjoy!
